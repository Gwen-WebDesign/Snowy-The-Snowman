       <h1> Snowy </h1>
        <p> Snowy is a charming snowman, his round snowball body comprised of three perfectly staked spheres, gradually decreasing in size from bottom to top. He has a broad smile, radiating warmth and friendliness. Draped around his neck is an olive color scarf. Atop his head rests a black hat. Snowy brings joy and laughter wherever he goes. </p>
